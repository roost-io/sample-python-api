================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'id' parameter in the 'get' method is not properly validated before being used in the 'find_one' method. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious input and potentially perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive data.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the 'id' parameter. Validate that it meets the expected format and data type before using it in any database queries or other sensitive operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The code does not properly validate or sanitize the 'id' parameter before using it to retrieve a book. If the 'id' parameter is constructed using user-supplied input, an attacker could potentially manipulate it to perform path traversal attacks and access files outside the intended directory.
Solution: Implement strict validation and sanitization of the 'id' parameter. Ensure that it only contains allowed characters and does not contain any path traversal sequences (e.g., '../'). Consider using secure functions like 'os.path.abspath' and 'os.path.normpath' to resolve file paths securely.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information
Issue: The code directly returns a '404' error message when a book is not found. Returning detailed error messages can potentially expose sensitive information about the system or the underlying data.
Solution: Instead of returning a specific '404' error message, consider returning a generic error message that does not reveal sensitive details. Log the specific error details on the server-side for debugging purposes, but do not expose them to the client.

================================================================================
Here are the test scenarios for the provided `get` method:

Scenario 1: Successfully retrieve a book by ID
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_by_id_success
  Description: This test verifies that the `get` method successfully retrieves a book when provided with a valid ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sample book object and add it to the database or mock the `find_one` method to return the sample book.
  Act: Invoke the `get` method with the ID of the sample book.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the sample book object.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `get` method correctly retrieves a book from the database when given a valid ID, which is a fundamental requirement for the book retrieval functionality.

Scenario 2: Handle non-existent book ID
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_by_id_not_found
  Description: This test verifies that the `get` method handles the case when a book with the provided ID does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that no book with the specified ID exists in the database or mock the `find_one` method to return `None`.
  Act: Invoke the `get` method with the non-existent book ID.
  Assert: Check that the method returns a tuple containing the string "Not found" and the HTTP status code 404.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `get` method correctly handles the scenario where a requested book ID does not exist, returning an appropriate error message and status code. This behavior is important for providing meaningful feedback to the client when a resource is not found.

Scenario 3: Test response marshaling with book model
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_response_marshaling
  Description: This test verifies that the `get` method correctly marshals the returned book object using the `@api.marshal_with(book)` decorator.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sample book object and add it to the database or mock the `find_one` method to return the sample book.
  Act: Invoke the `get` method with the ID of the sample book.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a Flask response object with the expected JSON representation of the book, as defined by the `book` model.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `get` method correctly serializes the retrieved book object into the expected JSON format using the provided `book` model. Proper response marshaling is crucial for delivering consistent and structured data to the client.

Scenario 4: Test error response format
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_error_response_format
  Description: This test verifies that the `get` method returns the error response in the expected format when a book is not found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that no book with the specified ID exists in the database or mock the `find_one` method to return `None`.
  Act: Invoke the `get` method with the non-existent book ID.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a tuple containing the string "Not found" as the first element and the integer 404 as the second element.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `get` method adheres to the expected error response format, returning a tuple with an error message and the appropriate HTTP status code. Consistent error response formatting is important for proper error handling and client communication.

These test scenarios cover the key aspects of the `get` method's business logic, including successful retrieval, handling of non-existent books, response marshaling, and error response format. They ensure that the method behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements.
