================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure direct object reference
Issue: the 'id' parameter in the get method is not validated, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary objects
Solution: validate and sanitize the 'id' parameter to ensure it conforms to expected formats and ranges

Vulnerability: information disclosure
Issue: the get method returns a 404 error with a 'Not found' message, which can aid an attacker in determining the existence of specific objects
Solution: return a generic error message instead of 'Not found', and consider implementing rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks

Vulnerability: cwe-117: improper output neutralization for logs
Issue: the get method returns data directly from the find_one method, which may contain unvalidated user input, potentially leading to log injection
Solution: ensure that any user-input data is properly sanitized and encoded before logging or returning it

Vulnerability: cwe-776: incomplete mediation
Issue: the get method does not appear to perform any access control checks, allowing unauthorized access to objects
Solution: implement access control mechanisms, such as authentication and authorization, to restrict access to authorized users

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the provided method:

**Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of a book by ID**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_success
  Description: Verify that the `get` method returns a book instance when a matching ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Book` instance with a valid ID.
  Act: Call the `get` method with the valid ID.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a book instance and its ID matches the provided ID.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the `get` method correctly retrieves a book by its ID, which is a fundamental aspect of the business logic.

**Scenario 2: Non-existent book ID**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_not_found
  Description: Verify that the `get` method returns a "Not found" response with a 404 status code when a non-existent book ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Book` instance with a non-existent ID.
  Act: Call the `get` method with the non-existent ID.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a tuple containing the string "Not found" and the integer 404.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the `get` method correctly handles the case where a book with the provided ID does not exist, which is an expected error condition.

**Scenario 3: Invalid ID format**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_invalid_id_format
  Description: Verify that the `get` method returns a "Not found" response with a 404 status code when an invalid ID format is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Book` instance with an invalid ID format (e.g., a string instead of an integer).
  Act: Call the `get` method with the invalid ID format.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a tuple containing the string "Not found" and the integer 404.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the `get` method correctly handles invalid input data, which is an expected error condition.

**Scenario 4: ID is None**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_id_none
  Description: Verify that the `get` method returns a "Not found" response with a 404 status code when the ID is None.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Book` instance with an ID of None.
  Act: Call the `get` method with the ID of None.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a tuple containing the string "Not found" and the integer 404.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the `get` method correctly handles the case where the ID is None, which is an expected error condition.

**Scenario 5: Edge case - ID is an empty string**
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_id_empty_string
  Description: Verify that the `get` method returns a "Not found" response with a 404 status code when the ID is an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `Book` instance with an ID of an empty string.
  Act: Call the `get` method with the ID of an empty string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a tuple containing the string "Not found" and the integer 404.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the `get` method correctly handles the edge case where the ID is an empty string, which is an expected error condition.
