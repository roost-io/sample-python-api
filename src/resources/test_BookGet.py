Scenario 1: Test the scenario when the 'get' function returns a match
Details:
  TestName: test_get_returns_matching_book
  Description: This test will verify whether the function 'get' returns the correct match when it exists in the book database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock database of books where one book matches the given id.
  Act: Call the 'get' function by passing in the id of the existing book.
  Assert: The function should return the book corresponding to the given id.
Validation:
  This test validates that the 'get' function successfully finds and returns a book object when a match is found. This is critical to ensure users can retrieve books correctly.

Scenario 2: Test the scenario when the 'get' function does not find a match
Details:
  TestName: test_get_returns_not_found_when_no_match
  Description: This test will validate that the 'get' function returns a "Not found", 404 error response when no matching book is found.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock database of books and maintains an id that doesn't correspond to any book.
  Act: Call the 'get' function with the non-existing book id.
  Assert: The function should return a "Not found", 404 response.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the 'get' function correctly responds to unmatched book id requests, which is essential to inform users when requested resources are not available.

Scenario 3: Test the scenario when the 'get' function is called with an id that was previously valid
Details:
  TestName: test_get_returns_not_found_after_book_removed
  Description: This test verifies that the 'get' function returns a "Not found", 404 response when it's called with an id that was valid previously but the corresponding book got removed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock database of books and remove a book.
  Act: Call the 'get' function with the id of the removed book.
  Assert: The function should return a "Not found", 404 response.
Validation:
  This test validates that the 'get' function appropriately reflects changes in the book database, which is important for maintaining data consistency.

Scenario 4: Test the scenario when the 'get' function is called concurrently
Details:
  TestName: test_get_returns_correct_result_when_called_concurrently
  Description: This test verifies that the 'get' function returns the correct results even when called concurrently.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a mock database of books. Create multiple threads or processes to call the 'get' function simultaneously.
  Act: Each thread or process calls 'get' function with different book ids.
  Assert: Each invocation of the 'get' function should return the correct result.
Validation:
  This test validates the 'get' function's capability to handle concurrent requests, which is necessary for a smooth user experience in a multi-user environment.
