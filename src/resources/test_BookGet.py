Here are the pytest test scenarios for the provided get method:

Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of an existing book
Details:
  TestName: test_get_existing_book
  Description: This test verifies that the get method successfully retrieves a book when provided with a valid ID of an existing book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with a specific ID and add it to the system.
  Act: Call the get method with the ID of the existing book.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the expected book object.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the get method correctly retrieves a book when given a valid ID. It validates that the find_one method is called with the correct ID and returns the matching book object.

Scenario 2: Attempt to retrieve a non-existent book
Details:
  TestName: test_get_nonexistent_book
  Description: This test verifies that the get method returns a "Not found" message with a 404 status code when provided with an ID that does not correspond to any existing book.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that no book with the specified ID exists in the system.
  Act: Call the get method with the non-existent book ID.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a tuple containing the string "Not found" and the integer 404.
Validation:
  This test is important to validate that the get method handles the case when a requested book does not exist. It ensures that the appropriate error message and status code are returned, adhering to the expected behavior defined in the business requirements.

Scenario 3: Retrieve a book with ID 0
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_with_id_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the get method can successfully retrieve a book with an ID of 0, if such a book exists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with an ID of 0 and add it to the system.
  Act: Call the get method with the ID 0.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the expected book object with ID 0.
Validation:
  This test covers an edge case scenario where the book ID is 0. It ensures that the get method can handle and retrieve a book with an ID of 0 correctly, demonstrating the robustness of the implementation.

Scenario 4: Retrieve a book with a large ID
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_with_large_id
  Description: This test verifies that the get method can handle and retrieve a book with a very large ID value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a book object with a large ID value and add it to the system.
  Act: Call the get method with the large ID value.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the expected book object with the large ID.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the get method can handle large ID values without any issues. It validates that the method can correctly process and retrieve books with IDs that are at the upper limit of the allowed range, ensuring the stability and reliability of the system.

Scenario 5: Retrieve a book with a None ID
Details:
  TestName: test_get_book_with_none_id
  Description: This test verifies that the get method returns a "Not found" message with a 404 status code when provided with None as the ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that no book with a None ID exists in the system.
  Act: Call the get method with None as the ID.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a tuple containing the string "Not found" and the integer 404.
Validation:
  This test validates that the get method handles the case when None is provided as the ID. It ensures that the method does not raise any exceptions and returns the appropriate error message and status code, maintaining the expected behavior and robustness of the system.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the get method's behavior, including successful retrieval, handling of non-existent books, edge cases with specific ID values, and error conditions. They ensure that the method adheres to the defined business logic and requirements.
