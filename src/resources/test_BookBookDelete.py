================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The delete method is insecure because it does not perform any authorization check before deleting a book. An attacker could guess the ID of a book and delete it from your database.
Solution: Implement an authorization check before deleting any book. Ensure only authenticated users can delete the books, and they can only delete books they own.

Vulnerability: Cross-site scripting (XSS) or CWE-79
Issue: An attacker could inject malicious script or payload in id input and thereby can perform cross-site scripting. This may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all inputs. Use Python libraries like WTForms for form data, or jsonschema for validating JSON data. For query string parameters, Flaskâ€™s Request object automatically applies strict character filtering unless you explicitly disable it.

Vulnerability: Flask Debug Mode CVE-2019-1010083
Issue: Running Flask applications in debug mode in a production environment, allows execution of arbitrary code, which can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and have every privilege as flask application.
Solution: Debug mode should be used in development from a local host, and should never be used in a Production environment.

Vulnerability: Global Variable Modification (or CWE-367)
Issue: The global keyword is used, which can lead to modification of a global variable that may not be thread-safe, causing unpredictable results and potential data loss.
Solution: Avoid the use of global variables in this context. Consider using other approaches for sharing state across your application, such as database systems.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test Delete Book with Valid Id
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_with_valid_id
  Description: This test verifies the deletion of a book record from the books_db using the delete method. The test checks if the book with the specified id is removed from the books_db after the delete operation.
Execution: 
  Arrange: A book with a specific id is added to the `books_db` list. 
  Act: The delete method is invoked with the book id as the parameter. 
  Assert: The returned book should match the added book and books_db should not contain the deleted book.
Validation: 
  This test is important for validating the basic functionality of the delete method, ensuring it successfully removes a book from the books_db based on id.

Scenario 2: Test Delete Book with Non-Existent Id
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_with_non_existent_id
  Description: This test scenario validates the business logic of the delete method when attempted to delete a book which doesn't exist.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure `books_db` contains some books, but not a book with the id that will be used in this test case.
  Act: Invoke the `delete` method using a nonexistent id.
  Assert: The delete function should return None and the size and content of `books_db` should remain unchanged.
Validation: 
  This test case is vital to confirm the delete method's ability to handle cases when the book to be deleted doesn't exist in the database. It reassures that the method doesn't unnecessarily modify the books_db or raise unexpected exceptions.

Scenario 3: Test Delete Method on Empty Book Database
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_on_empty_books_db
  Description: This test validates the delete method's behavior on an empty books database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure `books_db` is empty.
  Act: Invoke the `delete` method with any id.
  Assert: The delete method should return None and `books_db` should remain empty.
Validation: 
  This scenario tests the edge case where `books_db` is empty. It ensures that the delete method meaningfully handles such situations without raising unexpected exceptions or modifying books_db inappropriately.  

Scenario 4: Test Delete Method Multiple Consecutive Times on Same Id 
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_multiple_times_same_id
  Description: This test checks the delete method's behavior when deleting the same id consecutively.
Execution:
  Arrange: Add a book with a specific id to the `books_db`.
  Act: Invoke the `delete` method twice consecutively with the same id.
  Assert: The first deletion should return the deleted book, while the second should return None. After both deletions, `books_db` should not contain the deleted book.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the delete method performs as expected even under repeated deletion attempts on the same id - it deletes only once and thereafter behaves as if the id doesn't exist.
