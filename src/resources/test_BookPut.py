================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: The code updates a match with 'api.payload' without sanitizing the input, potentially allowing stored XSS if unsanitized user input is reflected on web pages.
Solution: Sanitize inputs by encoding special HTML characters or use template systems that automatically handle this. Validate inputs on arrival against a whitelist of allowed values.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: Accepting user input without validation or sanitization can lead to various security issues like SQL Injection, XSS, etc., depending on how the input is used.
Solution: Implement strict input validation using a combination of whitelist validation on the server-side, and sanitization of inputs, especially before using them in SQL queries, HTML content, or command-line invocation.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Returning the 'match' object directly to the client can inadvertently expose sensitive information or implementation details, depending on the object's properties.
Solution: Implement an output sanitization layer to strip sensitive information from objects before they are sent to the client or use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) to control exactly what data is exposed via API responses.

================================================================================
Below are the test scenarios for the `put` method described:

### Scenario 1: Update Existing Book
Details:
  TestName: test_put_update_existing_book
  Description: This test verifies that an existing book's details are correctly updated when the valid data is passed.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock book object that simulates an existing book, including its `id`. Prepare a payload with updated book details.
  Act: Call the `put` method, passing the `id` of the existing book and the payload as parameters.
  Assert: Check if the book's details have been updated with the payload. Assert the match on the updated fields and the id remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the business logic for updating an existing book's details works as intended and that the process retains the book's identity by not changing the id.

### Scenario 2: Attempt Update on Non-existent Book
Details:
  TestName: test_put_non_existent_book
  Description: This test checks the behavior when the `put` method is called with an `id` for which no book exists.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure no book exists for a given `id`. Prepare a payload with book details.
  Act: Call the `put` method with the non-existent `id` and the payload.
  Assert: Expect a return value of `None` to indicate that no existing book was matched for update.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical for verifying that the method handles cases where an attempt is made to update a book that does not exist in the system gracefully, without throwing unexpected errors.

### Scenario 3: Successfully Update Book Without Changing ID
Details:
  TestName: test_put_update_does_not_change_id
  Description: Ensures that updating a book's details does not lead to a change in the book's `id`.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and add a book to the mock database with a specific `id`. Prepare a payload with updated details.
  Act: Call the `put` method with the same `id` and the payload.
  Assert: Verify that the returned book object's `id` matches the original `id`, ensuring the update process does not change the book's identity.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the update logic correctly maintains the unique identifier of each book even after modification, adhering to the principle that `id` should be a constant reference to a specific book.

### Scenario 4: Update Partial Book Details
Details:
  TestName: test_put_update_partial_details
  Description: Verify that partial updates are supported, meaning only specified fields in the payload are updated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create and add a mock book with complete details. Prepare a payload with only a few fields for update.
  Act: Call the `put` method with the book's `id` and the partial update payload.
  Assert: Check that only the fields present in the payload are updated, while others remain unchanged.
Validation:
  The ability to perform partial updates is essential for flexibility in modifying book records. This test confirms the method's capability to apply changes precisely as intended, without side effects on unspecified fields.

These scenarios ensure thorough testing of the `put` method's functionality, focusing on the accurate updating of book records, edge cases of non-existent records, and the integrity of book identifiers through updates.
