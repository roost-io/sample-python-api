Scenario 1: Updating an existing book entity
Details:
  TestName: test_update_existing_book_details
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function successfully updates an existing book's data using the id and the payload provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a book entity with a specific id.
  Act: Invoke the function with the specific book id and a payload containing updated book details.
  Assert: Check if the book details have been updated as per the payload.
Validation:
  This is an important test to ensure that the business logic to update existing books in the system by providing an id and payload is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Attempting to update non-existent book entity
Details:
  TestName: test_update_non_existent_book
  Description: This test is to verify the function's behavior if we attempt to update a book that does not exist in the system.
Execution:
  Arrange: No book entity needs to be set up because the system does not contain that book.
  Act: Call the function with a book id that does not exist in the system and a payload.
  Assert: The expected outcome is a null object, indicating that no match was found for the provided id. This scenario should handle this gracefully and not crash or propagate errors.
Validation:
  The test verifies that the function correctly handles non-existing entries by returning null, ensuring system stability and providing a consistent user experience.

Scenario 3: Updating a book entity without any modifications on the payload
Details:
  TestName: test_update_book_without_modifications
  Description: This test is designed to validate how the function handles attempts to update a book with a payload that does not introduce any changes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book entity.
  Act: Invoke the function with the same book's id and a payload identical to the existing book data.
  Assert: There should be no changes to the book’s details.
Validation:
  This scenario is important to confirm that the function can accurately detect and handle cases where no modifications are made. 

Scenario 4: Updating a book entity with id included in the payload
Details:
  TestName: test_update_book_payload_includes_id
  Description: The test is designed to confirm how the function behaves when the payload for an update includes the id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a book entity that contains the id within its properties.
  Act: Invoke the function using the id of the book and a payload that includes the id.
  Assert: Check that the function ignores the id from the payload and uses the id passed as argument while updating.
Validation:
  It’s crucial to ensure that the system does not allow id changes as it is often a primary key that uniquely identifies an entity for efficient referencing and searching. 

Scenario 5: Updating a book entity with missing attribute in the payload
Details:
  TestName: test_update_book_missing_attribute_payload
  Description: This scenario is intended to validate the behavior of the function when the payload does not contain all of the book's attributes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a book entity.
  Act: Call the function with the book id and a payload missing an attribute.
  Assert: Ensure the missing attribute in the book's data remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can handle incomplete payloads without negatively affecting the book's data.
