Scenario 1: Test function with book id present in books_db
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_with_id_present
  Description: This test verifies if the 'delete' function correctly removes the book with the specified id from the book_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Insert a book with known id into the books_db.
  Act: Invoke the 'delete' function by passing the known book id.
  Assert: Check if the returned book from the 'delete' function matches the known book and 'books_db' no longer contains the book with the known id. 
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the function can successfully delete a book from the database when the id of the book is provided, which is a vital requirement of the function. 

Scenario 2: Test function with book id not present in books_db
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_with_id_not_present
  Description: This test verifies if the 'delete' function correctly handles the scenario when a non-existent book id is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: No need for special arrangements as we're passing non-existent id.
  Act: Invoke the 'delete' function by passing the non-existent book id.
  Assert: Check if the return of the 'delete' function is None.
Validation:
  This scenario is significant for testing the robustness of the function by providing the id that does not exist in the database. It ensures that the function does not break under these conditions.

Scenario 3: Test function with empty books_db
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_with_empty_db
  Description: This test verifies if the 'delete' function can handle the scenario when called with an empty 'books_db'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Make sure 'books_db' is empty.
  Act: Invoke the 'delete' function by passing any id (since the DB is empty, any id will be non-existent).
  Assert: Check if the return of the 'delete' function is None.
Validation:
  This test provides confidence that the function will not break and instead will return a predictable output when it operates on an empty books database, which is an edge case for this function.

Scenario 4: Test function with multiple books with the same id
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_with_duplicate_ids
  Description: This test verifies if the 'delete' function correctly removes all books with the same id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Insert multiple books with a known id into the books_db.
  Act: Invoke the 'delete' function by passing the known id.
  Assert: Check if 'books_db' no longer contains any books with the known id.
Validation:
  This test ensures that if duplicate ids exist in the 'books_db', the function will still behave as expected and delete all corresponding book entries.
