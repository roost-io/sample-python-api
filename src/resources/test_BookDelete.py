Scenario 1: Book exists in the database
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_exists
  Description: This test is intended to verify the successful deletion of a book that exists in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a database books_db with some books, including a book with a unique ID that matches the ID to be deleted.
  Act: Invoke the delete method with the ID of the book that is contained in the database.
  Assert: Check that the returned book matches the book with the provided ID and it is no longer present in the database.
Validation:
  This test is important as it verifies the primary functionality of the delete method - removing a book from the database. This matches the business requirements to manage the database by removing the selected book.

Scenario 2: Book does not exist in database
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_not_exists
  Description: This test is intended to confirm the functionality of the delete method when the ID provided does not exist in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a database books_db with some books, ensuring that the ID to be deleted does not exist in the database.
  Act: Invoke the delete method with the non-existing ID.
  Assert: The returned value should be None and the state of the database should remain unchanged.
Validation:
  This test is important in ensuring the delete method behaves as expected when attempting to delete a book that does not exist. This is critical for maintaining the integrity of the database and ensuring error conditions are properly handled.

Scenario 3: Database is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_empty_db
  Description: This test is intended to confirm the functionality of the delete method when the database is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty books_db.
  Act: Invoke the delete method with any ID.
  Assert: The returned value should be None and the database should remain empty.
Validation:
  Even though the database being empty is an edge case, it is important to test such a state where resources are unavailable. It will ensure that the code is robust by efficiently checking for resources before performing operations. 

Scenario 4: Multiple copies of the same book are listed
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_book_multiple_copies
  Description: This test is intended to confirm that when the delete method is invoked with the ID of a book that exists multiple times in the database, all copies are deleted.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a books_db with some books, ensuring multiple books share the same ID to be deleted.
  Act: Invoke the delete method with the ID shared across multiple books.
  Assert: Check that none of the books with the provided ID exist in the database.
Validation:
  This is an edge case test scenario. As per business rules, IDs should be unique, but assuming were not the case, the function should ensure that all duplicates are removed too. This also supports overall business requirements of database's integrity and accurate content.
