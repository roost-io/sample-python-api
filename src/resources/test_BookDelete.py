Scenario 1: Testing the delete function with valid ID
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_valid_id
  Description: This test is intended to verify the delete function when we pass a valid book ID. It checks whether the book is removed from the book database or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the book database with different sets of book data, and consider one of the book's ID that needs to be deleted.
  Act: Invoke the delete method by passing the selected book's ID.
  Assert: Check whether the returned book is the book intended to delete and no longer appears in the book database.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the delete method works as expected when provided with a valid book ID. It is essential according to the business requirement of maintaining the book database accurately.

Scenario 2: Testing the delete function with invalid ID
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_invalid_id
  Description: This test is intended to verify the delete function when we pass an invalid or non-existent book ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the book database with the available sets of book data.
  Act: Invoke the delete method by passing an invalid or non-existent book ID.
  Assert: Check whether the returned book is an empty object and no changes occurred to the book database.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function handles an invalid book deletion request correctly, which is critical for maintaining the integrity of the book database.

Scenario 3: Testing the delete function when the book database is empty
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_from_empty_db
  Description: This test is intended to verify the delete function behavior when the book database is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the book database as empty.
  Act: Invoke the delete method by passing any book ID.
  Assert: Check whether the returned book is an empty object and the book database remains empty.
Validation:
  This scenario is essential to ensure the function handles the edge case when the book database is empty. It ensures that the function does not cause errors in such conditions, which can impact the system's performance and reliability.

Scenario 4: Testing the delete function when multiple books have the same ID
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_duplicate_id
  Description: This test is intended to verify the delete function behavior when there are multiple books with the same ID in the book database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the book database with multiple books having the same ID.
  Act: Invoke the delete method by passing the duplicated book ID.
  Assert: Check whether all books with the passed ID are removed from the book database.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle the unusual condition of multiple books having the same ID and ensures that the entire record related to the deleted ID is removed, maintaining the accuracy of the book database.
