Scenario 1: Verify the function with valid book id
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_valid_book_id
  Description: The test will verify that a book with the given id is correctly removed from the books_db
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a book id that exists in the books_db.
  Act: Call the delete function with the id as parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned book matches the id, and the book is not present in books_db.
Validation:
  This test verifies the delete function's primary functionality. If this function does not work as expected, the application may not be able to remove a book, leading to invalid data in the future.

Scenario 2: Verify the function with invalid book id
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_invalid_book_id
  Description: This test will verify the functionality when the book with the given id does not exist in the books_db.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a book id that does not exist in the books_db
  Act: Call the delete function with the id as parameter.
  Assert: Check that the returned match is None, and the books_db remains same as before.
Validation:
  This test is essential to verify that the function handles non-existing book ids gracefully, returning None and leaving the books_db unchanged. This ensures stability and robustness in the overall system.

Scenario 3: Verify the function with the only book left in books_db
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_last_book_id
  Description: This test will check if the delete function can handle deleting the last book in the database and leaves the books_db empty after deleting
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the books_db with only a single book.
  Act: Call the delete function with the id of the last book as parameter.
  Assert: Checks that the returned book matches the id and that the books_db is empty.
Validation:
  This test scenario is important as it checks the edge case of deleting the last remaining book. This ensures the function behaves as expected in all circumstances, avoiding any potential errors or exceptions.

Scenario 4: Verify the function with the initial empty book database
Details:
  TestName: test_delete_empty_books_db
  Description: Test to validates the behavior of the function when books_db is already empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the books_db as an empty list.
  Act: Call delete function with any book id.
  Assert: The function should return None, and the books_db list remains empty.
Validation:
  The scenario is important to ensure that even in case of an empty book database, the function behaves correctly without throwing any unhandled exceptions and the database state remains consistent.
