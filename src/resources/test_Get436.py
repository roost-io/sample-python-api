================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'id' parameter in the 'get' method is not properly validated before being used in the 'find_one' method. This could allow attackers to inject malicious input and potentially perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive data.
Solution: Implement proper input validation and sanitization for the 'id' parameter. Validate that it meets the expected format and type before using it in any database queries or other sensitive operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
Issue: The code does not properly validate or sanitize the 'id' parameter, which could potentially allow an attacker to manipulate the parameter to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
Solution: Ensure that the 'id' parameter is properly validated and sanitized to prevent path traversal attacks. Use secure methods to construct file paths and restrict access to only the intended directories.

Vulnerability: CWE-918: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Issue: The 'find_one' method may be vulnerable to SSRF if it allows external URLs or IP addresses to be passed as the 'id' parameter. An attacker could potentially use this to make unauthorized requests to internal or external systems.
Solution: Implement proper validation and filtering of the 'id' parameter to ensure that it only contains expected values and does not allow external URLs or IP addresses. Use a whitelist approach to validate the parameter and restrict it to only the intended values.

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the provided get method:

Scenario 1: Successful retrieval of an existing book
Details:
  TestName: test_get_existing_book
  Description: This test verifies that the get method successfully retrieves a book when provided with a valid book ID.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sample book object and add it to the database or mock the find_one method to return the sample book.
  Act: Call the get method with the ID of the sample book.
  Assert: Check that the returned value matches the sample book object.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the get method correctly retrieves a book from the database when given a valid ID, fulfilling the basic functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Handling non-existent book ID
Details:
  TestName: test_get_nonexistent_book
  Description: This test verifies that the get method handles the case when a non-existent book ID is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure that no book with the specified ID exists in the database or mock the find_one method to return None.
  Act: Call the get method with a non-existent book ID.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is a tuple containing the string "Not found" and the HTTP status code 404.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the get method correctly handles the scenario where a book with the given ID does not exist, returning an appropriate error message and status code.

Scenario 3: Marshalling the returned book object
Details:
  TestName: test_get_marshalling
  Description: This test verifies that the get method correctly marshals the returned book object using the provided book model.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a sample book object and add it to the database or mock the find_one method to return the sample book.
  Act: Call the get method with the ID of the sample book.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is an instance of the book model and contains the expected attributes.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the get method properly marshals the retrieved book object using the provided book model, conforming to the expected API response format.

Scenario 4: Handling database connection error
Details:
  TestName: test_get_database_error
  Description: This test verifies that the get method handles database connection errors gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the find_one method to raise an exception simulating a database connection error.
  Act: Call the get method with any book ID.
  Assert: Check that the method catches the exception and returns an appropriate error message and HTTP status code (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error).
Validation:
  This test ensures that the get method is resilient to database connection errors and provides a meaningful error response to the client, maintaining the stability and reliability of the API.

These test scenarios cover the main aspects of the get method's business logic, including successful retrieval, handling non-existent books, marshalling the response, and handling database errors. They provide a comprehensive set of tests to ensure the method behaves as expected and meets the specified requirements.
