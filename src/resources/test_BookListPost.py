Scenario 1: Post with an Empty Database
Details:
  TestName: test_post_with_empty_db
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the function works correctly when posting data to an empty database.
Execution:
  Arrange: An empty books_db list needs to be initialized.
  Act: The post method is invoked with a mock payload.
  Assert: The returned payload is checked against the initial mock payload and the id should be 0. 
Validation:
  This test is important because it reflects the initial state of the database. The expected result is that the function should be able to handle empty database scenario and assign id as 0 is business requirement.

Scenario 2: Post with a Non-Empty Database
Details:
  TestName: test_post_with_non_empty_db
  Description: Verify if the function is capable of handling a non-empty database, creating a new book object with the correct id.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize books_db with one or more book objects. Create a mimic payload.
  Act: The post function is called with the new mock payload. 
  Assert: Check if the returned payload has its id one plus the id of the last book in the list. The new payload should also be appended into the books_db list.
Validation:
  This test is crucial as it verifies the function would behave as expected under normal operating conditions by incrementing the id by one of the last book in list.

Scenario 3: Post with Duplicate Information
Details:
  TestName: test_duplicate_book_post
  Description: Verify if the function can handle situations where the payload is a duplicate of an already existing book in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize books_db with one or more books. Create a mimic payload identical to an existing book.
  Act: Invoke the post method using the mimic payload.
  Assert: Check if the returned payload is identical to the mimic payload (except id). The new payload should be appended to the books_db list. The id should be incremented from the last book in the list, not matching the previous duplicate book.
Validation:
  This test is important because it verifies the id uniqueness despite duplicate payloads, adhering to unique identifier business requirement. 

Scenario 4: Testing the Return Value of Post Function
Details:
  TestName: test_return_value_of_post
  Description: Check if the return value of the post function is identical to the posted payload.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize books_db with a book. Create a mimic payload.
  Act: Call the post function using the mimic payload.
  Assert: Verify the return value of the function against the payload sent in.
Validation:
  This is a key scenario since it ensures the return values accurately represent a successful post operation, this mirrors the fact that new book details should be returned on successful post operation.
