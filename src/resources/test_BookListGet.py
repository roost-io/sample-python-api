Scenario 1: Testing the return of all books in the database
Details:
  TestName: test_get_all_books
  Description: This test will verify whether the function returns all the books present in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate the database with some books.
  Act: Call the get function.
  Assert: Check if the returned list matches with the list of books present in the database.
Validation:
  This test validates the basic functionality of the get function to retrieve and return all the book records from the books database.


Scenario 2: Testing the return when there are no books in the database
Details:
  TestName: test_get_no_books
  Description: This test is designed to check whether the system handles the situation when there are no books in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Ensure the book database is empty.
  Act: Call the get function.
  Assert: The system should return an empty list.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function handling of edge cases where the database is empty in order to minimize any potential errors.


Scenario 3: Testing the data integrity of returned books
Details:
  TestName: test_get_books_data_integrity
  Description: This test assures that the data integrity is preserved. The book object retrieved should preserve all its original data.
Execution:
  Arrange: Place a known book object into the book database.
  Act: Call the get function.
  Assert: Expect that the returned book object corresponds to the known book object placed prior in terms of all its properties.
Validation:
  This scenario is critical to ensure that the function does not omit or lose any data while retrieving books from the database.


Scenario 4: Testing the order in which books are returned
Details:
  TestName: test_get_books_order
  Description: This test determines whether the order of books returned by the function follows any specific pattern or random.
Execution:
  Arrange: Insert an ordered list of books into the book database.
  Act: Execute the get function.
  Assert: Verify if the order of books on return is same as it was on insertion or any specific pattern.
Validation:
  This scenario is relevant to check if the function maintains a particular order for the list of books. This could be crucial if the order of books in the list is related with certain business rules like sorting by certain fields.


Scenario 5: Testing size of the returned list of books
Details:
  TestName: test_get_books_list_size
  Description: This test is meant to verify whether the size of the list of books returned by the function matches the total number of books present in the database.
Execution:
  Arrange: Note the count of books currently in the database.
  Act: Call the get function.
  Assert: Verify if the count of books in the returned list matches the count noted earlier before the function call.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures that the function is returning all the available books present in the database. Any discrepancy can indicate bugs related to book retrieval from the database.
