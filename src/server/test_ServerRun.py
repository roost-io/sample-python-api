================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: insecure debug mode
Issue: debug mode allows attackers to access sensitive information about the application
Solution: remove or restrict debug mode, set environment_config['debug'] to False in production

Vulnerability: unvalidated user input
Issue: using environment_config['port'] without validation can lead to unexpected behavior
Solution: validate environment_config['port'] to ensure it's a valid port number

Vulnerability: insecure imports
Issue: importing from a custom environment.instance module can lead to code execution
Solution: validate and sanitize inputs from environment.instance, consider using a secure configuration mechanism

================================================================================
Here are the pytest test scenarios for the `Server.run` method:

Scenario 1: Successful Server Start with Debug Mode Enabled
Details:
  TestName: test_server_run_debug_enabled
  Description: Verify that the server starts successfully with debug mode enabled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Server` object with `environment_config["debug"]` set to `True`.
  Act: Call the `run` method.
  Assert: Check that the server is running with debug mode enabled.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the server starts correctly with debug mode enabled, which is a critical aspect of the business logic.

Scenario 2: Successful Server Start with Debug Mode Disabled
Details:
  TestName: test_server_run_debug_disabled
  Description: Verify that the server starts successfully with debug mode disabled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Server` object with `environment_config["debug"]` set to `False`.
  Act: Call the `run` method.
  Assert: Check that the server is running with debug mode disabled.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the server starts correctly with debug mode disabled, which is another important aspect of the business logic.

Scenario 3: Server Start with Invalid Port Number
Details:
  TestName: test_server_run_invalid_port
  Description: Verify that the server raises an error when started with an invalid port number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Server` object with `environment_config["port"]` set to an invalid port number (e.g., a string or a negative number).
  Act: Call the `run` method.
  Assert: Check that a `ValueError` or similar exception is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the server correctly handles invalid port numbers, which is a critical error condition.

Scenario 4: Server Start with Port Number Out of Range
Details:
  TestName: test_server_run_port_out_of_range
  Description: Verify that the server raises an error when started with a port number out of range (e.g., < 0 or > 65535).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Server` object with `environment_config["port"]` set to a port number out of range.
  Act: Call the `run` method.
  Assert: Check that a `ValueError` or similar exception is raised.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the server correctly handles port numbers out of range, which is another important error condition.

Scenario 5: Server Start with Environment Config Missing
Details:
  TestName: test_server_run_missing_env_config
  Description: Verify that the server raises an error when started with missing environment configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Server` object without setting `environment_config`.
  Act: Call the `run` method.
  Assert: Check that a `KeyError` or similar exception is raised.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the server correctly handles missing environment configuration, which is a critical error condition.

Scenario 6: Server Start with Environment Config Malformed
Details:
  TestName: test_server_run_malformed_env_config
  Description: Verify that the server raises an error when started with malformed environment configuration (e.g., `environment_config` is not a dictionary).
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize the `Server` object with `environment_config` set to a malformed value (e.g., a list or a string).
  Act: Call the `run` method.
  Assert: Check that a `TypeError` or similar exception is raised.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the server correctly handles malformed environment configuration, which is another important error condition.
