Scenario 1: Validate the Application Running in Debug Mode
Details:
  TestName: test_app_run_in_debug_mode
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the application runs in debug mode when the 'debug' config in the environment is set to True. In debug mode, the server should automatically provide useful debugging information if there are any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'debug' key in `environment_config` to `True`. Instantiate `app`.
  Act: Call `app.run()`.
  Assert: Check that the application is running in debug mode.
Validation:
  This decides the execution of the application. It's necessary to ensure that debug mode functions as expected to facilitate any necessary debugging of the application.

Scenario 2: Validate the Application Running on Specified Port
Details:
  TestName: test_app_run_on_specific_port
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the application runs on the port specified by the 'port' config in the environment settings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'port' key in `environment_config` to a specific number. Instantiate `app`.
  Act: Call `app.run()`.
  Assert: Check that the application is running on the specified port.
Validation:
  Ports are the endpoints of the application services. Being able to specify the port on which the application server runs allows the server to be accessed. This means it's crucial to ensure that the 'port' environment setting is respected.

Scenario 3: Confirm Application Fallback to Default
Details:
  TestName: test_app_run_with_default_config
  Description: This test ensures that in the absence of 'debug' or 'port' parameters in the environment, the application uses Flask's defaults: debug=False and port=5000.
Execution:
  Arrange: Remove the 'debug' and 'port' keys from `environment_config`. Instantiate `app`.
  Act: Call `app.run()`.
  Assert: Ensure that the application is not running in debug mode and the server is running on port 5000.
Validation:
  In the absence of specific settings, the application should run with default values. This is important to ensure a predictable behavior of the application under non-specific configurations. Confirming this behavior helps prevent unexpected results. 

Scenario 4: Confirm Error When Invalid Port Number is Given
Details:
  TestName: test_run_with_invalid_port
  Description: This test validates that the application throws an error when an incorrect or invalid port number is used.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the 'port' key in `environment_config` to an invalid port number. Instantiate `app`.
  Act: Call `app.run()`.
  Assert: Check that an error is thrown.
Validation:
  Port numbers have accepted ranges (0-65535), and certain ranges are reserved. A port number outside this range, or a port reserved for other purposes, should result in an error. This helps ensure that the application adheres to proper port usage requirements.
