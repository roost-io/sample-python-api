Scenario 1: Verify that the application runs with the configured debug mode
Details:
  TestName: test_app_runs_with_debug_mode
  Description: This test verifies that the application runs with the debug mode specified in the environment configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the environment configuration with a specific debug mode value.
  Act: Invoke the `run` method of the application.
  Assert: Check that the application runs with the configured debug mode.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the application respects the debug mode setting specified in the environment configuration. It validates that the application behaves correctly based on the configured debug mode, which is crucial for development and production environments.

Scenario 2: Verify that the application runs on the configured port
Details:
  TestName: test_app_runs_on_configured_port
  Description: This test verifies that the application runs on the port specified in the environment configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the environment configuration with a specific port value.
  Act: Invoke the `run` method of the application.
  Assert: Check that the application runs on the configured port.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the application uses the correct port as specified in the environment configuration. It validates that the application is accessible on the expected port, which is essential for proper deployment and accessibility of the application.

Scenario 3: Verify that the application handles missing environment configuration gracefully
Details:
  TestName: test_app_handles_missing_environment_config
  Description: This test verifies that the application handles the scenario where the environment configuration is missing or incomplete.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the environment with missing or incomplete configuration values.
  Act: Invoke the `run` method of the application.
  Assert: Check that the application handles the missing configuration gracefully, either by using default values or raising an appropriate error.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the application is resilient to missing or incomplete environment configurations. It validates that the application can handle such scenarios gracefully, either by falling back to default values or providing meaningful error messages, preventing unexpected behavior or crashes.

Scenario 4: Verify that the application starts the Flask development server when debug mode is enabled
Details:
  TestName: test_app_starts_flask_development_server_in_debug_mode
  Description: This test verifies that the application starts the Flask development server when the debug mode is enabled in the environment configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the environment configuration with debug mode enabled.
  Act: Invoke the `run` method of the application.
  Assert: Check that the Flask development server is started and running.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the application correctly starts the Flask development server when the debug mode is enabled. It validates that the application leverages the development server features, such as automatic reloading and detailed error pages, which are beneficial during development and debugging phases.

Scenario 5: Verify that the application starts the production server when debug mode is disabled
Details:
  TestName: test_app_starts_production_server_in_non_debug_mode
  Description: This test verifies that the application starts the production server when the debug mode is disabled in the environment configuration.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up the environment configuration with debug mode disabled.
  Act: Invoke the `run` method of the application.
  Assert: Check that the application starts the production server (e.g., gunicorn or uWSGI) instead of the Flask development server.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the application uses a production-grade server when the debug mode is disabled. It validates that the application is deployed in a production-ready manner, leveraging the performance and stability benefits of a dedicated production server.
